# Snake
Now that we are familiar with how drawing will work, lets move on to **Snake**. We'll be exploring many different factors we can use to change the game. Some will change the game aesthetically, while others actually raise or lower the difficulty, depending on how they are tweaked. If you're really good, you'll even be able to make changes that will actually change the mechanics of the game!
### Game Constants
We will start off with some simple constants for the game. Try playing around with these values, and notice the changes they make in the game. Just like the first section, `UPDATE_TIME` will change the speed of the program, and as you could probably guess, the other three change the color of the background, snake, and food, respectively.

let SNAKE_COLOR = #colorLiteral(red: 0.3579192162, green: 0.7339857817, blue: 0.4819219708, alpha: 1)

### Snake Class
Similar to the `Pattern` class from last section, in this section we will be doing most of experimenting in the `Snake` class.

### Variables
In addition to `board` and `cells` from last section, we also have `food`, `snake`, `direction`, `lastDirection`, and `ateFood`. You'll see later on in the code why it is essential for to have these new variables. If you want to make a change and need a new member variable, add it here.

/*:
### Set Up
Here is where we set up our workspace for **Snake**. We call `begin()` so that it is executed right at the beginning of the program, we call the initial `update()` that will call itself every `UPDATE_TIME` seconds, and we set up `swipe()` to hande the user inputs of swiping up, down, left, and right. In `swipe()`, see what happens if you swap `direction = 0` and `direction = 1`. If you did it correctly, you will see that moving left and right get switched.

### Begin
Since we need to be able to handle a new game when we lose anyway, we have `newGame()`, making `begin()` pretty simple. Feel free to add anything in here that might be necessary (for example, a variable that carries over from game to game might have to be set here, not `newGame()`).

### Update
Here is a quick and important lesson for game development. An update function should always go something like this: **[Input -> Move -> Collisions -> Draw]**. Since in this program, the timing of the input function is handled for us, we stick as close to this rule as possible with **[Move snake -> Check for food collisions -> Check for snake collisions -> Draw]**. If there is extra functionality that you come up with to add to the update function, try to maintain this rule with what you do in order to stay organized.
